# Unicorn Attractor - Issue Tracker

A fully responsive web application for tracking issues of the Unicorn Attractor app.

Issues come in two varieties - bugs and features.

Users can create issue tickets to let developers know of any bugs they've come
across while using the Unicorn Attractor app or to share their suggestions on
features they'd like to see implemented in order to improve the app. 

To help developers get an idea of the number of occurances of each bug and of the
most sought after features, users have the ability to upvote and comment on issue tickets. 
The higher the number of upvotes a bug or a feature request has, the more its prioritized.

The aim is to spend 50% of development time fixing bugs and 50% implementing new features. 
Unfortunately, development time is expensive so in order to be able to achieve this aim,
upvoting feature requests costs money. Users can buy upvotes at the price of &euro;5 per upvote.
They can then upvote a feature request an unlimited amount of times as long as they posses upvotes.
On the other hand, upvoting a bug is free but a user can only upvote each bug once.
Payments are processed securely through Stripe and customer details are not saved anywhere.

Full transparency is offered to the users regarding the amount of work being done. 
Each issue has a progress status to let users know if the work on it has begun or if its been compeleted.
The home page contains charts showcasing the number of issues that have been completed the previous 7 days
and 12 months, the number of issues per status, as well as summaries of issues by popularity and date.

## UX

Inspired by [GitHub](https://github.com) and the [Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-IE/)
website, built using the [Bootstrap 4.3.1](https://getbootstrap.com/) framework. 

* On the homepage, a user is first presented with a login form and an option to register
  in order to allow them to contribute right away, as well as a link to view all current issues. 
  The homepage contains information about the Issue Tracker and how it works as well as a section
  to display various statistics regarding existing issues.
  Upon a successfull login, registration or log out, users are presented with a success message.

* The navigation bar contains links to pages where users can view all existing issues, only issues
  of type bug or only issues of type feature request. On each of the 3 pages, issues can be sorted
  by highest number of upvotes or comments through a dropdown menu. All 3 pages contain the button
  for creating an issue so that users don't have to waste time searching for it.

* The page for creating an issue is simple. A form with 3 fields.

* In list view, each issue occupies its own row so as not to have the content be too busy. The most
  relevant information about an issue is presented on the left side of the row, that being the type,
  status, title and date of creation while the right side contains information regarding the number
  of upvotes and comments, and the dates for last update or if completed, date of completion.

* In order to spare users having to scroll endlessly through a long list of issues, they are limited
  to 10 per page. Navigation links for navigation to previous/next pages only show once there is more
  issues than can fit on the page.

* Clicking on an issue's title will take the user to a page containing the details and comments of the
  issue. This is also the page where users can upvote the issue and post comments. Besides the
  information supplied on the previous list view of issues, this page contains description/content and
  the button used to delete an issue which only the author or the issue can see. Total number of comments
  display at one time is 10, after that users have to go to the next page of comments.

* Besides the links to issue pages, the navigation bar also contains links for a user's profile, home,
  login, logout and registration. The profile page displays information about the user, the number of
  upvotes they own and their profile picture, as well as buttons which allow for purchasing more upvotes
  or changing the profile picture. Every user has the default profile image starting off and in case
  there is no picture to display.

* When a user wants to purchase upvotes, they are taken to a page with a
  [Bootstrap Input Spinner](https://github.com/shaack/bootstrap-input-spinner) to select the amount of
  upvotes. The input spinner lets a user increase the number by holding down the button which is
  especially usefull on mobile devices.

* Once a user selects an amount of upvotes and click continue, they are taken to a page with feedback on
  their purchase and the card form to fill out in order to pay for the upvotes.

* When the purchase is complete, the user is presented with their new total amount of owned upvotes and
  a button to take them to the all issues page.

    apps, take a look at 
    [django's documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/testing/overview/)
    * Or `pip3 install coverage` to install 
    [coverage.py](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/v4.5.x/)
        * then to run all tests `coverage run --source='.' manage.py test`
        * to run tests only on specific a app 
        `coverage run --source='.' manage.py test appname(e.g. accounts)`
        * run `coverage report` for an in-terminal report on results or 
        `coverage html` which will generate a new folder `htmlcov`. 
        * Inside the `htmlcov` folder locate `index.html` and run it.

* Other tests:
    * [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/)
      * Used for testing html
    * [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
